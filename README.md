# Rock, Paper, Scissors... Shoot!

This is the first JavaScript project on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). I learned a lot about Functions, Callbacks and the Document Object Model (DOM). All in all it was a pretty fun project!
